The Box Trot brings the best feature from the 22w13oneblockatatime April Fools snapshot - being able to put a barrel on your head - to 1.18 and up!

With expansions upon the original idea, such as letting you wear armour as a barrel, displaying as a block to anyone who mouses over you, players being able to open your inventory when you're a barrel, and more, you can sneak around someone's base without fear of being caught out easily!
